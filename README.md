# Star Wars 101

This is the frontend for my Star Wars 101 project, an app meant for Star Wars newbies. It is paired with the starwars_backend repo (https://github.com/alexiscait142/starwars_deploybackend).

This app is also fully deployed at:
https://starwars101mod4.herokuapp.com/ & 
https://starwars101mod4.firebaseapp.com/


## Getting Started/Installing

Fork and clone this repo. This is a React app so it will require React and Javascript. You will need to run:

```
npm install
```

to install all the required libraries. Then run:

```
npm start
```

to start the server.
