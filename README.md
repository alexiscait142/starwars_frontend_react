# Star Wars 101

This is the frontend for my Star Wars 101 project, an app meant for Star Wars newbies. It is paired with the starwars_backend repo (https://github.com/alexiscait142/starwars_deploybackend).

This app is also fully deployed at:
* https://starwars101mod4.herokuapp.com/
* https://starwars101mod4.firebaseapp.com/

App functionality:

* View information oncharacters, movies, planets, and animals from the Star Wars universe.
* Filter through the information cards by name (and species for characters, and episode numbers for movies).
* Take simple quizzes on characters and animals (match the name to the photo).
* Sign in/login to add to the database.


## Getting Started/Installing

Fork and clone this repo. This is a React app so it will require React and Javascript. You will need to run:

```
npm install
```

to install all the required libraries. Then run:

```
npm start
```

to start the server.
